# Supersonic Nozzle Design Calculation Program
# Created by Jason Chen, Project Caelus
# Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology
# Developed on April 22nd, 2018

""" 
This program generates important parameters in a conical supersonic converging-diverging
nozzle from certain user inputs. Below is a full list of this program's capabilities and
key thermodynamic assumptions. Many input parameters can be obtained from NASA's CEA program
(Chemical Equilibrium with Applications), which is available freely available to the
public for download here (https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/CEAWeb/).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALL CALCULATIONS ARE DONE IN STANDARD IMPERIAL (SI) UNITS, WITH TEMPERATURE IN KELVIN.
ANGLES IN DEGREES.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CALCULATION ASSUMPTIONS:
    1) Flow maintains equilibrium at the local pressure and enthalpy level (reversible).
    2) No heat transfer across gas-enclosure walls; closed system (adiabatic).
    3) By definition, the flow is isentropic due to assumptions 1 and 2.
    4) Flow composition is considered frozen (tends to underestimate performance by 1-4%).
    5) Working fluid obeys the perfect gas law.
    6) All species of the working fluid in the flow is gaseous.
    7) Wall friction is negligible and all boundary layer effects are ignored.
    8) There are no shock waves or other discontinuities within the nozzle flow.
    9) Propellant mass flow rate is constant and steady.
    10) Expansion of the working fluid is uniform and steady; no significant turbulence.
    11) All exhaust gases travel with a velocity parallel to the nozzle axis.
    12) Gas velocity, pressure, temperature, & density are all uniform across any section
        perpendicular to the nozzle axis.
    13) Nozzle dimensions assume an optimum divergence half-angle of 15 degrees, and an
        optimum convergence half-angle of 45 degrees.
    14) Contraction ratio (cross-sectional area of the chamber/area of the throat) of 8.
